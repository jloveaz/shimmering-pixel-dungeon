# Shimmering Pixel Dungeon
Shimmering Pixel Dungeon is a fork of 00-Evan's Shatter Pixel Dungeon.

The core reasons for the change:
- I wanted to
- Change some of the architecture around identification (not enough concern around identifying potions and scrolls, and to some degree wands)
- Attempt to add more movement based mechanisms.
- Debuff ring of movement
