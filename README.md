# Shimmering Pixel Dungeon
Shimmering Pixel Dungeon is a fork of 00-Evan's Shatter Pixel Dungeon.

The core reasons for the change:
- I wanted to
- Change some of the architecture around identification (not enough concern around identifying potions and scrolls, and to some degree wands)
- Attempt to add more movement based mechanisms.
- Debuff ring of movement


Currently in the pipeline:
- ~~Add danger to drinking random potions~~
- Add some danger to reading random scrolls
  - Make reading random scrolls potentially dangerous even on relatively cleared floors
- Add some additional enemies
  - For fun
